    <p>REQUIREMENTS (FIRST DRAFT) TEAM A 

 

The system must be able to recommend original routes to the user based on input. 

 

The recommended trails should preferably pass through a certain number of small quaint Shinto shrines in Japan. In case the system could not recommend a route passing through shrines while matching inputs, it will either insert more concurred and bigger shrines or simply a regular route.  

 

The user must be able to first select from three options, each of them offering different kinds of inputs on which the route generation system will be based to calculate a recommended route: 

 

Option A must allow distance, the desired level of physical activity, and terrain type as user inputs. 

 

 

Option B must allow a starting point, an endpoint, and the desired level of physical activity as user inputs. 

 

 

Option C must allow the adventure level and the desired duration of the route as the user inputs. 

The adventure level is a scale of several levels differentiated based on the number of shrines and the difficulty in getting to them.
