    <p> TEAM A's FIRST DRAFT  </p>

 
<p>
The system must be able to recommend original routes to the user based on input. 

    </p>
    <p>

The recommended trails should preferably pass through a certain number of small quaint Shinto shrines in Japan. In case the system could not recommend a route passing through shrines while matching inputs, it will either insert more concurred and bigger shrines or simply a regular route.  

    </p> <p>

The user must be able to first select from three options, each of them offering different kinds of inputs on which the route generation system will be based to calculate a recommended route: 

   </p>   <p>

Option A must allow distance, the desired level of physical activity, and terrain type as user inputs. 

     </p> <p>

 

Option B must allow a starting point, an endpoint, and the desired level of physical activity as user inputs. 

 
 </p>
     <p>

Option C must allow the adventure level and the desired duration of the route as the user inputs. 
         
        </p>   <p>

The adventure level is a scale of several levels differentiated based on the number of shrines and the difficulty in getting to them.
